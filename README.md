## For a C:
### Sketch of Mirror:

### For a B:
I have implemented for General Information: Personalized Calendar: Which is my list of tasks for a certain day; News Feed: Which is being read in from an API Call, this API call does have a limit for the day and if that limit was hit it could also go the News.json file; The Current Clock with time; and the Local Weather also being read in from an API Call; however, this one does not have a limit
I have implemented for Health-Related Information- The ammount of sleep in hours a person got over night

### For an A:
I have chosen to implement the lighting feature that can be clicked on or off with a button. There is no set color to this light as this light can be any random set of colors it would like.
