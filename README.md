### Issues of Current Design:
The current issue with the current design is there isn't any flow of buttons in a certain order. 1,2,3 are in a triangle and the door open, alarm, and pull stop button are in a triangle formation as well. This allows for confusion of where a button might be if you couldn't see the buttons. Also, there are lights that turn on when an emergency happens that aren't in any particular order either.

### Explain Why it is Good or Bad:
This elevator is both good and bad. It is bad in that it is a very old outdated elevator and does not follow the design rules as many elevators do today. The other reason that is bad is the design flaws of the buttons not lining up. It is a good elevator in that it has braille for those who do not know what the buttons are can read it and press the coresponding button as well as lower set for those who are handicapped. 

## B Questions:
### Common uses and rare uses of Elevator:
The most common use of an elevator is going up and down between floors either in a school buildling, apartment, or a hotel. The rare use of an elevator is going to a floor lower than floor 1 or to the basement. Another rare use of an elevator is using the alarm or call button. When an elevator is stopped and can't open this is when these butttons are used otherwise they are hardly used.

### Common Sequence of Actions and how does the Interface support these sequences:
The most common sequence of actions is going into the elevator and clicking what floor the user needs to go to and then pressing the closing the door button. Another common sequence is going inside and pressing the open door button to hold it open for other people to walk inside. In the new user interface it is made easier the click what floor you want since it is all in one row and there is now a close door button for when a person wants to close the door after choosing a floor versus waiting for the door to close.

### How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work?
The elevator uses both numbers printed, braille, and in the new interface voice text to tell the user what it is doing. So whether you are able or disabled you should be able to use the elevator.

### How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?
The elevator provides light feedback as well voice feedback as to what is being pressed to make the elevator move.

### What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?
I think some common mistakes that you can make with this current design is making sure that the buttons go from floor to ceiling in terms of numbers and getting the door open/close and alarm/call buttons confused with one another since they are close together and in the same square formation.

### Sketch of New Design:

### Justification of New Design Choices:
Firstly, The elevator screen was all the way at the top of the elevator and made it hard to read to see what floor you were on or were going to. I have suggested lowering the elevator screen and it also now reads to you what action you are taking. For example "Going to floor One!". The Second Change is going to square touch buttons instead of circles since some are broken and also matches the rectangle layout of the braille numbers or words next to the button. The third change is aligning the number buttons to be stacked on top of each other. The fourth change is aligning the next buttons in a square below the numbers and adding a close button and chaning the pull stop to a call button.

## A Questions:
### Touch Screen Design? And other helpful features:
Yes I want my elevator design to be a touch screen however on this screen I still want there to be braille so a blind user can still use the elevator. I also want the screen size to be lower on my elevator to allow handicapped user to be able to use the elevator. The design also allows for when the call or alarm button is pressed to cancel moving to any floors.
